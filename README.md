Introduction
This serverless application processes financial transactions, anonymizes personal data, evaluates risk, and stores the results securely. The application is built using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and TypeScript.

Architecture
AWS Lambda: Functions for data processing stages (anonymization, encryption, risk assessment, storage, and retrieval).
API Gateway: Manages incoming HTTP requests and responses.
AWS S3: Stores processed data securely (can be skipped for local JSON file storage).
Setup
Prerequisites
AWS account
Node.js installed
AWS CLI configured
Installation
Clone the Repository

sh
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd financial-record-serverless
Install Dependencies

sh
Copy code
npm install
Set Up AWS Services

Create an S3 bucket for storing processed data (optional).
Configure API Gateway and Lambda in the AWS Management Console or using AWS CLI.

Data Processing
Anonymization
Personal identifiers are anonymized by generating consistent pseudonyms across sessions.

Encryption and Hashing
Symmetric Encryption (AES-256)
Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)
Important fields are hashed for integrity checks.
Risk Assessment
A complex algorithm evaluates the risk associated with each transaction based on factors like amount, frequency, geographical location, and past transaction behavior.

Data Enrichment
External data sources are integrated to enrich transaction data with additional information, such as currency conversion rates and regional economic indicators.

Storage and Retrieval
Storage
Processed results are securely stored in an S3 bucket with encryption at rest. For local testing, data can be stored in a JSON file.

Retrieval
A Lambda function is provided to query results based on encrypted or hashed identifiers.

Testing
Comprehensive unit tests are developed for each component, particularly focusing on the integrity of the cryptographic functions and the accuracy of the risk assessment algorithm. Testing includes:

Data enrichment integrations
Anonymization consistency across multiple data points
