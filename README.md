 This project involves developing a serverless application to anonymize sensitive financial data, perform risk assessment calculations based on dynamic criteria, and securely store the results. The solution leverages AWS services, TypeScript, and cryptographic functions to ensure data security and integrity.

Architecture
AWS Lambda: Functions for data processing stages (anonymization, encryption, risk assessment, storage, and retrieval).
API Gateway: Manages incoming HTTP requests and responses.
AWS S3: Stores processed data securely (can be skipped for local JSON file storage).
Setup
Prerequisites
AWS account
Node.js installed
AWS CLI configured
Installation
Clone the Repository

sh
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd financial-record-serverless
Install Dependencies

sh
Copy code
npm install
Set Up AWS Services

Create an S3 bucket for storing processed data (optional).
Configure API Gateway and Lambda in the AWS Management Console or using AWS CLI.

Data Processing
Anonymization
Personal identifiers are anonymized by generating consistent pseudonyms across sessions. This involves:

Hashing the user ID to create a pseudonym.
Masking email addresses and phone numbers to hide real information while retaining format.
Encryption and Hashing
Symmetric Encryption (AES-256): Used to encrypt sensitive fields.
Asymmetric Encryption (RSA): Used to encrypt the AES key parts.
Hashing: Important fields (e.g., transaction IDs) are hashed to maintain integrity.
Risk Assessment Algorithm
The risk assessment algorithm evaluates the risk associated with each transaction based on multiple factors. The algorithm uses statistical methods and possibly heuristic approaches for evaluating risk. This involves:

Calculating the mean and standard deviation of transaction amounts.
Flagging transactions that are significantly higher or lower than average (using Z-scores).
Considering frequency and geographical location.
Data Enrichment
External data sources are integrated to enrich transaction data with additional information. This can include:

Currency conversion rates.
Regional economic indicators.
Historical transaction data for the user.
Storage and Retrieval
Storage
Processed results are securely stored in an S3 bucket with encryption at rest. For local testing, data can be stored in a JSON file.

Retrieval
A Lambda function is provided to query results based on encrypted or hashed identifiers. This ensures that data retrieval is secure and consistent with the anonymization and encryption protocols.

Testing
Comprehensive unit tests are developed for each component, particularly focusing on the integrity of the cryptographic functions and the accuracy of the risk assessment algorithm. Testing includes:

Validating data enrichment integrations.
Ensuring anonymization consistency across multiple data points.
Verifying encryption and decryption processes.
Detailed Explanations
Calculations
Anonymization
Hashing User ID: hashedUserId = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(userId).digest('hex')
Masking Email: maskedEmail = email.replace(/(\w{2})[^@]*(?=@)/, "$1***")
Masking Phone: maskedPhone = phone.replace(/(\d{3})\d*(\d{2})/, "$1*****$2")
Encryption
AES Encryption:
typescript
Copy code
const aesKey = crypto.randomBytes(32);
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from(aesKey), iv);
let encrypted = cipher.update(data);
encrypted = Buffer.concat([encrypted, cipher.final()]);
RSA Encryption:
typescript
Copy code
const rsaKeyPair = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {
  modulusLength: 2048,
  publicKeyEncoding: {
    type: 'pkcs1',
    format: 'pem'
  },
  privateKeyEncoding: {
    type: 'pkcs1',
    format: 'pem'
  }
});
const encryptedKey = crypto.publicEncrypt(rsaKeyPair.publicKey, Buffer.from(aesKey));
Risk Assessment
Calculating Z-score:
typescript
Copy code
const mean = calculateMean(transactionAmounts);
const stdDev = calculateStdDev(transactionAmounts);
const zScore = (transactionAmount - mean) / stdDev;
if (Math.abs(zScore) > threshold) {
    // flag as anomaly
}
Assumptions
Transactions are independent events.
The anonymization must be reversible for pseudonym consistency.
Risk factors are static and do not change dynamically within the same assessment period.
